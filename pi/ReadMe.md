# Raspberry Pi setup script

This directory contains a setup script that can be used to setup a new raspberry pi so it has everything it needs to run
pipe-it-up.

## Prerequisites
In order for everything in this script to work properly, a user pipeitup with sudo and dialout permissions has to be
setup. The script should then be started with the user `pipeitup` with the command `bash ./setup.sh`
